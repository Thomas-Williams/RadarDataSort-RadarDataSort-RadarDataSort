#CRREL Radar Sort
This project was made for the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory to process data pulled from a NASA database of ground penetrating radar (GPR) datasets. This data was storted by transects (the line a plane carrying the GPR system flies) and we needed all the data for a specific bounding box. This program takes GPD coordinates as input to define the desired box, and sorts through the data to pull the GPR data from all transects that include data from that region.
